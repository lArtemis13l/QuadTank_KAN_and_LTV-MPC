Symbolic read-out utilities.

The manuscript's methodological contribution lives here.  Rather than deploying
whatever pykan's `auto_symbolic` happens to return, the pipeline is split into
two clearly separated steps:

  (1) STRUCTURE SELECTION.  The trained KAN is pruned and each surviving
      univariate activation is replaced by the best symbolic candidate from a
      declared library.  Expanding the resulting composition gives a *sparse
      monomial support* S -- this is what the KAN contributes, and it is the
      only thing taken from the network.

  (2) SHAPE-CONSTRAINED COEFFICIENT FIT.  The coefficients on S are then
      re-estimated by a convex quadratic program

          min_c || A(S) c - u_mpc ||^2
          s.t.   d/de_j [ c^T m(phi) ] (phi^(l)) >= 0   for l = 1..L

      i.e. the closed-loop-relevant monotonicity (negative feedback) of the law
      is imposed as a *linear inequality* on the coefficients, evaluated on a
      dense sample of the operating box.  The program is convex, so its
      solution is unique and requires no expert intervention -- this replaces
      the manual sign correction of the original submission.

Both the unconstrained and the constrained fit are reported so that the price
of the guarantee is visible.

    Both constraint families are LINEAR in the coefficients, which is the whole
    point of reading the network out as a polynomial:

      * G collects rows d/de_j of the monomial basis at sample points, so
        G c >= 0 states that a positive level error never reduces the
        corresponding pump command;
      * Aeq collects rows m(phi) evaluated at (x_eq(r), r) for a set of
        reachable references, so Aeq c == 0 states that the learned *deviation*
        from the analytic feed-forward input vanishes exactly at every
        equilibrium.  Together with u = u_eq(r) + dpi this removes the
        steady-state offset that a static approximate policy would otherwise
        inherit from its imitation error.

    Neither constraint is expressible for a general multilayer perceptron: they
    are available precisely because the read-out is linear in its parameters.
    The programme is convex, so the solution is unique.
