Stage 2b -- simplification of the symbolic read-out, and the accuracy-versus-
complexity comparison against direct sparse polynomial regression.

For a term budget k the deployed law keeps the k monomials of the KAN-selected
support that orthogonal matching pursuit ranks highest, and re-estimates their
coefficients under the negative-feedback shape constraint of Eq. (12).  The
identical sweep is run with the support chosen from the *full* degree-4
dictionary, which is exactly "fitting the polynomial directly using
conventional regression techniques"; comparing the two curves isolates what the
KAN actually contributes.

Local exponential stability is not something this stage has to search for: the
gate w(e) of policyform.py makes the learned correction and its Jacobian vanish
at every set-point, so the closed-loop linearisation there is A(r) - BK for the
LQR gain K of the teacher's own cost, whatever was learned.  The certificate is
nevertheless recomputed for every candidate and recorded, so the claim is
checked rather than assumed.

Outputs results/sparsity_sweep.json and models/symbolic_law_{regime}.npz.
