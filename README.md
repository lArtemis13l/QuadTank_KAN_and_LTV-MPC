# Certifiable approximation of model predictive control laws

**Author:** Adilkhan Salkimbayev — **Licence:** Apache-2.0 — **Status:** manuscript under review

Code and data for a study of what can and cannot be certified about an offline
approximation of a linear time-varying MPC law, on the Johansson quadruple-tank
benchmark in both its minimum-phase (MP) and non-minimum-phase (NMP) configurations.

Everything reported in the accompanying manuscript is produced by the numbered stage
scripts in [`QuadTank_Project/revision/`](QuadTank_Project/revision). Start there.

## What the study finds

The deployed controller is

```
u = sat[ u_eq(r)  +  K e  +  w(e) * U_max * f(phi(x, r)) ]
     feed-forward   LQR core   learned correction
```

with a gate `w(e) = min(||e||^2 / s^2, 1)` that vanishes quadratically at the set-point.

| Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|
| The **symbolic read-out**, not the network, is a dominant error source | MP: a 2.43 % imitation error becomes 7.85 % under off-the-shelf `auto_symbolic`; a convex refit recovers it to 5.51 %. NMP: 4.45 % → 10.97 % → 9.11 % |
| An unconstrained read-out **violates negative feedback** on up to 30 % of the operating box | Driven to 0 % (MP) / 0.4 % (NMP) by an affine inequality inside a convex least-squares fit, for ≤ 0.2 pp of accuracy — and in NMP the constraint *improves* accuracy |
| The gate makes **zero steady-state offset and local stability structural** | Substituting random coefficients (σ up to 100) leaves the closed-loop spectral radius unchanged to ~1e-10 |
| KAN support selection is **not measurably better** than direct sparse regression | Across 11 term budgets × 2 regimes the two curves sit within a few tenths of a percentage point of each other; neither dominates |
| The benchmark **cannot justify distillation** | With a horizon that spans the inverse response the MPC beats a well-tuned gain-scheduled LQR by only 7–9 %, so there is little for any approximator to lose |

Deployed law: **4 terms/pump (MP, 30 multiply–accumulates)** and **48 terms/pump
(NMP, 203)**, certified locally exponentially stable (ρ ≤ 0.9988) at every set-point
tested, 97–100 % stable under ±20 % parameter perturbation.

### Two benchmark properties the design turns on

Both are established by `s00_horizon_study.py` and Section 3 of the manuscript before any
distillation result is reported, because either one, got wrong, prevents the closed loop
from converging at all — and no approximation of a teacher that does not converge means
anything.

* **Not every commanded target is an equilibrium.** With two pumps the equilibrium set is
  two-dimensional: fixing `(h1, h2)` determines `h3, h4`. In the NMP regime the
  equilibrium at (10, 10) is `[10, 10, 4.16, 3.44]` cm, so a target such as
  `[10, 10, 2, 2]` is unreachable and *no* controller — the MPC included — can drive its
  cost to zero. Every reference used here is an exact solution of the equilibrium
  equations.
* **The prediction horizon must span the inverse response.** The right-half-plane zero
  has a 69 s time constant. At N = 30, a prediction step of Δt_p = 0.1 s gives a
  **3-second** horizon, and a myopic controller on a non-minimum-phase plant moves in the
  wrong direction: the loop drifts away from a reachable equilibrium and command activity
  rises to 439–714 V of total variation. Δt_p = 4 s spans 120 s and fixes both, with the
  control loop still running at 0.1 s.

## Repository layout

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `QuadTank_Project/revision/` | **Current.** The pipeline behind the manuscript — see its [README](QuadTank_Project/revision/README.md). |
| `QuadTank_Project/quad_tank_golden_reference_P_minus.csv` | **Current dependency.** A single closed-loop trajectory at a fixed reference, whose rank deficiency the identifiability analysis in `s03` diagnoses. |
| `QuadTank_Project/*.ipynb`, `Data/`, `Nucleo_MPC_GenFinal/`, other `*.csv` and `*.pdf` | **Superseded.** Retained for provenance only. |
| `legacy_photos/` | **Legacy.** Photographs of a hardware-in-the-loop bench and IDE from earlier exploratory work. Kept as a record; no result in the current paper depends on them. |

### On the superseded material

The notebooks, the generated OSQP C solver and the hardware-in-the-loop logs predate the
current pipeline. They are kept for provenance, not because they produce any current
result: nothing under `revision/` imports them, with the single exception of the
single-trajectory CSV noted above.

The STM32 firmware (`QT_HIL_Clean/`) has been deleted outright — nothing referenced it
once the hardware campaign left the paper. It remains recoverable from the git history
(`git log --all -- QT_HIL_Clean`).

The hardware campaign is not part of the study. Its latency and flash figures were
measured for a different symbolic law than the one now deployed, and the microcontroller
was not available for re-measurement, so retaining them would have mixed measured numbers
with carried-over ones. Computational cost is instead reported as an exact
multiply–accumulate count, which is a property of the control law rather than of a
processor. **Any speed-up figure appearing in the git history of this file is
withdrawn.**

## Changes after submission

The manuscript was submitted on 5 August 2026. The tag
[`submitted-jpc-2026-08-05`](https://github.com/cl0sure6/QuadTank_KAN_and_LTV-MPC/tree/submitted-jpc-2026-08-05)
marks the repository state at that moment.

That tag is provenance, not a reproduction target: at that commit the pipeline did
**not** produce every number in the submitted PDF. Auditing the manuscript's numeric
claims against the result files afterwards turned up one gap and three errors, all
corrected on `master`:

* **Added `s00_horizon_study.py`.** The prediction-horizon study behind Section 4.1 and
  the total-variation comparison in Section 6.2 were not produced by any script. They
  now are, along with the transmission zeros.
* **Corrected the 3-second-horizon total variation** to 439–714 V, the value the stage
  reproduces on the two tasks that section compares. The submitted PDF says 439–818 V.
* **Corrected two transmission zeros**, which had been rounded up: −0.0193 (MP) and
  +0.0145 (NMP), not −0.0194 and +0.0146. They are computed here, not taken from the
  benchmark's source, and the manuscript now says so.
* **Fixed the deployed term count** in Figure 3 and Table 3, which read "24 terms" and
  labelled a two-regime row with one regime's budget. It is 4 terms/pump (MP) and 48
  (NMP).

None of these changes a conclusion. They are recorded here so that anyone comparing the
released code against the submitted PDF can see precisely what differs and why.

Stage 0 runs first because every later stage inherits the horizon it settles; it is the
only stage that varies `dt_pred` away from the deployed `qtlib.DT_PRED = 4.0 s`.

Results land in `revision/results/`. `key_numbers.json` collects every quantity the
manuscript states in text, and `horizon_study.json` backs the horizon argument and the
transmission zeros.
