r"""
Policy parameterisation shared by every learned surrogate.

The deployed controller is

    u = sat[ u_eq(r)  +  K e  +  w(e) * U_max * f(phi(x, r)) ],
        \_______/     \___/     \_________________________/
        feed-forward  LQR core   learned nonlinear correction

with  e = r - x,  phi = [x/X_n, e/X_n],  and the gate

    w(e) = min( ||e||^2 / s^2 , 1 ).

Each term has a job and the split is what makes the controller certifiable:

* u_eq(r) is the exact steady-state input of the plant (qtlib.u_eq_of_ref) --
  two square roots and four multiply-accumulates.  It removes the steady-state
  offset that a static approximate policy would otherwise inherit from its
  imitation error.

* K is the discrete LQR gain of the *same* cost (Q, R) used by the MPC teacher,
  evaluated at the nominal equilibrium of the regime and then held constant.

* w(e) vanishes quadratically as e -> 0, so both the value and the Jacobian of
  the learned correction vanish at every reachable set-point, for any f
  whatsoever.  Consequently the closed-loop linearisation at a set-point is
  exactly A(r) - B K, independent of what was learned: local exponential
  stability is a *structural* property of the parameterisation, not something
  the fit has to be constrained into.  The learned term is free to model the
  predictive, constraint-aware behaviour that distinguishes MPC from LQR, which
  is precisely the behaviour that matters away from the set-point.

Setting LQR_CORE = False and GATE = False recovers the plain "learn u directly"
formulation of the original submission; both are reported in the ablation.
